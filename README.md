# PyBer Project Overview

The goal of this project was to give insights on a dataset aggregating ride-sharing data and production charts on the total weekly fares for each city type.

# Overview & results of the analysis

The figures and tables are based on a bataset that include 66 urbans cities, 18 rurals cities and 36 Suburbans cities with all the drivers and fare recorded for each area.

## Table 1: ride-sharing by city area

The table 1 present the tree cities at a high level. The urban region seems to be the most popular for the driver which would make sense because this is the most densified. By having the highest drivers, it generates also the highest rides count. The major downside of working in the most densified area would be the average salary is the lowest since each trip are shorter.

In order to asses the market activity, the figure show the price evolution from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-28 for the three regions.

### Recommendations

- The total fares evolution seems to be steady. From an external view, the ride-sharing is popular and we would expect a steady increase for total fares.
- Focus on Urban doing Suburban trips if possible when the the drivers are able to be near the Suburban area.
- Rural cities present a wild standard deviation. It could be possible that some rural are not fully aware of this service or simple against it.
